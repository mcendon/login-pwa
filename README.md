## Other project comments

Initially, the Firebase Authentication metadata.lastSignInTime field was proposed to be used as the last login field, but I found some issues like this one: https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk/issues/662 and the fact that lastSignInTime is updated before the login data is returned by the Auth service, causing the same result every time (clock always inits in zero).

I decided to use Firestore database with authentication to manage the lastSignInTime field read / update field manually as an approach to the solution.
